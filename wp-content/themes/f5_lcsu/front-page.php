            <h2 class="text-center">Strong, coordinated federal & state advocacy.</h2>
            <p>With partner state leagues across the United States, CUNA is able to advocate on Capitol Hill for all credit unions with the best insight and access of any trade association. With an equipped, empowered and organized army of credit union leagues and tens of thousands of grassroots advocates, CUNA is the most influential credit union trade association in Washington.</p>
             
            <p>Member credit unions in Florida and Alabama gain access to state and federal decision-makers through LSCU, influencing regulations and legislation at both the national level and state level, too. Member-exclusive newsletters, action alerts and more keep credit union leaders up to date on the latest and most-impactful regulatory and legislative issues.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-center">Real-time regulatory compliance help from experts.</h2>

LSCU members have access to responsive, dedicated, and well-known compliance experts Bill Berg and Mike Lee &mdash; only a quick text, phone call or email away.
 
            <p>Forward-thinking and innovative, LSCU has tapped into CUNA’s robust network of state and regional leagues to develop an online compliance network, TotalCompliance, boasting shared resources that work to the advantage of credit union leaders.</p>

            <p>CUNA’s extensive federal compliance resources, including the CUNA eGuide to Federal Laws & Regulations and its members-only Compliance Community provides credit unions the most comprehensive federal tools, networking and information.</p>
           
            <h2 class="text-center">Championing the cause of credit unions.</h2>
            <p>Our public-facing campaigns generate interest in credit unions and lead to growth for our members. That, combined with winning media outreach, gets our member credit unions’ message seen and heard in the media and among potential members.</p>
 
            <p>Campaigns such as LSCU’s Cooperative Image and CUNA’s Don’t Tax My Credit Union, Stop the Data Breaches, and Ease the Burden have track records of success, effectively communicating the credit union brand proposition to consumers to strengthen relationships with members and establish new relationships with potential members.
